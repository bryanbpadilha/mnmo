## Test component

This is a test documentation explanation. It's pretty long. Or not.

```html
<p>This is a test codeblock!</p>
```

<form>
    <label>
        <div>Email</div>
        <input type="email" name="email" required validation-message="Please use a valid email address." />
    </label>
</form>

<script>
    console.log('test');
</script>
